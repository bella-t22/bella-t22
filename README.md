Hi, I’m bella ;)
I’m interested in front-end web development!
-  I’m currently learning react and node, while also improving my skills in advanced javascript.
-  You can reach me by emailing me @ b.jtorr22@gmail.com
-  Fun fact: I love being active as well as creative! I enjoy waterskiing, snowboarding, wake-surfing, camping, reading, art, and gardening, as a few of my main hobbies.
